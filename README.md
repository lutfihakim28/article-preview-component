## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I have project using Vue.js before, but this is my first project using pure JavaScript. So, I have learn some JavaScript DOM manipulation.

However, the CSS part is make me feel confuse. Especially on layouting when I make it responsive.

What I learn from this project is nesting HTML element, layouting, and how to use JavaScript to make it interactive.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

Some parts on this project is need an improvement. Next time, I want to add some animation when I click the share button.

When I have learned API, I want to add some API on the share link, so when user klick on faceboock/twitter/pinterest icon, they will redirected to share dialog.
